Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
    Technically, encapsulation is way to hide data member from other classes and it can be accessed only through memberfunction of the own class in which it is declared.
    Data can be hidden from other classes by making the data private and there must be public classes to get and set variable.
