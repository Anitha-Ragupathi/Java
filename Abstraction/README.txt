Rules

// Abstraction class cannot be instantiated
//The purpose of abstraction class is to be inherited
//can have both abstract and non-abstract methods


// Encapsulation is data hiding
//Abstraction is detail hiding

//While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon data.
//Data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation
